# Branching logic
The branching logic portion is similiar to transducers, but allows you to apply logical branches based on if/else statements into your stream- without disrupting the stream flow.

## if

## elif

## else

## endif

## t
This is a ternary statement which can be applied immediately to a stream

```
Stream([1,2,3,4])
    .t(R.isEven, R.double, R.negate)
    // new stream is composed of [-1, 4, -3, 8]
```

## ttap
This is a ternary statement which can be applied immediately to a stream, but only taps the stream, does not transform it.

```
Stream([1,2,3,4])
    .ttap(R.isEven, R.double, R.negate)
    // new stream is still composed of [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
