# Transforming values

The ability to transform values is awesome. This is where the library really comes alive. These can be tacked together to create a stream of transformations which alter the existing stream, manipulating the data of the stream.

# Concepts
Most of these functions are either applied to each value of the stream and transform them (`add`), or are applied to each value and filter them (`allPass`). Some functions are blocking- meaning they will not pass the stream to the next function until all the values of the stream have been evaluated (`all`), but most are non-blocking. Some functions are ways to add two streams together (`intersperse`), these of course require two streams. For many functions, they are not just transforming the streams- but also applying some value (`add`). If the value being applied is not nessicarily of static value, then *I Will need to figure that out*.

Some functions are not meant to be used with streams at all, and serve primarily for the purpose of creating new functions that can be used with your streams.

Some functions (`adjust`) can be used by passing in functions using composition, or chaining them with a return statement. Either method is permitted.

# Definitions

| Section | Desc | Examples |
|:--------|:-----|---------:|
| Transform | These functions transform a stream by taking each element of the stream and changing it in some way. |
| Side-effect | These functions do not change the stream in anyway- simply pass values from the stream to another function for processing |
| Filter | These functions remove certain elements of the stream using some pre-determined logic. |
| Branching | These functions create branches in the stream, breaking the flow and returning to the next logical point after the branch has completed (branches are terminated by the `.return()` statement, which can take a value to be returned instead of the original if desired |
| Blocking | These functions wait until all elements of the stream (including the end of the stream) have arrived before continuing |
| Non-Blocking | These functions are applied to each individual member of the stream as they arrive. |
| Combining | These functions take 2 or more streams and create a single stream from them |
| UnAry | These functions take only a single argument, which is either the entire stream (`head`) or a single element from the stream (`negate`) |
| NAry | These funcitons take multiple arguments, which may either be static (`add(3)`) or dynamic (`add(x)`) depending on the use case. In this case, x will need to be determined by a functional value.|
| Non-Stream | These functions can not be applied to a stream, and are normally applied in the context of transforming a different function to better operate on the stream. Functions altered in this way can be chained normally |
| Chaining | Chaining happens when a function passes the results of it's own return to the last argument of the next. `f(x, g(h(x)))` == h(x).g().f(x)`. |
| Composed | Composed functions are functions that are placed inside of others in order to pass the results of it's own return to the last arguments of the next. `f(x, g(h(x))) == composed(f(x), g, h(x))` |
| Terminating/Continuation | Terminating functions will terminate a stream's execution if the conditions of the termination are met, or if the conditions of the continuation are not met.
| Switching | Switching statements will create a new stream from the previous one, normally of a single value that has been created by the previous stream |

## Basic functions

### e
This special function tells the stream that execution can now happen.

### r
This special function terminates a branch of the chain.

## From Arrays

### concat
* Combining
* Transform
* NAry

`concat(Stream)`

This function is called as a way to continue a single stream's end with a second stream.

```
const A = Stream(['1', '2', '3']) # :-1-2-3-|
const B = Stream(['a', 'b', 'c']) # :-a-b-c-|
const C = A.concat(B) # :-1-2-3-a-b-c-|
```
Events from stream B will be transmitted only after the end signal of Stream A has been reached. In this example, `Stream C` is a new stream which has been created and functions downstream of the concatanation will recieve events from `Stream B` after `Stream A` has completed.

### every
* Termination
* Blocking
* UnAry

`every(conditionalFN, Stream);`

This function will wait until all events on the stream have been recieved, and determine if every event on the stream passes the conditions.

```
Stream(['true', 'true', 'true'])
    .every() // checks for truthyness, stream will continue

Stream(['1', '2', '3'])
    .every(R.gt(0)) // checks for truthiness, every condition must be met, this stream will pass

Stream(['1', '2', '3'])
    .every()
        .allPass()
            .gt(0)
            .lt(2)
            .r() // this will return to the allPass Statement
        .r() // This will return to the everyStatement
    ... // The stream will be terminated before reaching this point.
```

Using the third example from above, we will introduce the concept of aliases and stream functions.

```
const A = Stream(['1', '2', '3']); // This will be used as an example throughout
const B = Stream(['a', 'b', 'c']); // This will be used as an example throughout

const between = (min, max) => Stream
                                .every()
	.allPass()
	    .gt(min)
	    .lt(max)
	    .r()
	.r();

A.between(0,2).e(); // This example uses the above alias (between) as a shortcut operator for determining if the stream should continue.

```
`.e()` is a special function that ends the stream consumption, telling the stream that it is ok to execute. Without the `.e()` function, the stream will not execute.

### fill
* Transformation
* Non-blocking

`fill(fillValue, startIndex, endIndex, Stream);`

This special function will convert elements to a new value when they pass through.

Fill accepts negative start/end indexs and treats them as operations performed on the length of a finite stream. On an infinte stream, negative values will nullify this function.

```
A.fill('A', 1, 2) # :-1-A-3-|
```

### filter
* filtering
* Non-Blocking

Filter takes a conditional argument and drops values that evaluate to false.

```
A.filter(R.lte(2)) # :-1-2-|
```

### find
* Non-Blocking
* Filter

Find will perform the same function as `filter`, however only the first matching value will be returned.

```
A.find(R.gt(1)) #:-2-|
```

### findIndex
* Non-blocking
* Filter
* Transform

FindIndex will perform the same operation as Find, except returning the index of the value- instead of the value itself.

If a value is passed instead of a function, then the value is used to compare.

```
A.findIndex(R.gt(1)) #:-1-| // Works as Array.findIndex
A.findIndex(2) #:-1-| // Works as Array.indexOf
```

### forEach
* Side-effect
* Non-Blocking

forEach performs an operation on the Stream for each value, and takes a callback function in:

```
A.forEach((value, index, Stream) => ...)
```

### includes
* Blocking (partial)
* Terminating

includes will block until a value fulfilling the callback is passed in, and then will let all values pass. If the end signal is recieved before a passing value is reached, the stream will terminate. All previous values will be passed through once a satisfying value has been recieved.

### join
* Transformation
* Blocking
* Switching

Join can be used to create a new stream which contains only 1 value, a joined version of all elements of the previous (finite) stream.

```
A.join() # :-123-|
```

### keys
* Transforming

This function passes only the key's from a stream through- instead of the actual stream.

### lastIndexOf
* Filtering
* Blocking

Finds the last index instance in an Stream, requires a finite stream

### lastOf
* Filtering
* Blocking

Finds the last instance in an Stream, requires a finite stream.

### map
* Transforming
* Non-Blocking

Transforms each element that is passed in, This will map over the statements and continue the stream with the new value.

### pop
Removes the last element of a finite stream and does not let it pass.

### push
Appends a new value to the Stream just before the end signal.

### reduce
* Blocking
* Transforming
* Switching

Reduces the Stream to a single value, taking a callback of the form

`Stream.reduce((previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, Stream) => ..., initialValue);`

### reduceRight
* Blocking
* Transforming
* Switching

This is the same as the reduce, but is blocking because it requires all elements of the Stream to arrive before reducing from Right to left.

### reverse
* Blocking
* Transforming

This will wait until the end signal and then reverse the order in which the Stream continues.

### shift
* Non-Blocking
* Filtering

Removes the first element of the Stream and prevents it from passing.

### slice
* Non-blocking
* Filtering

Prevents certain elements of the stream from passing based on their index.

### some
* Blocking (partial)
* Termination

Allows elements to pass only if at least 1 element satisfies the conditional.

### sort
* Blocking
* Transformation

Orders the elements based on a comparator function once all of the events have arrived. Events are ordered as they arrive, however, all elements must arrive before continuing the stream.

### splice
* Non-Blocking
* Transformation

Removes and inserts elements to the Stream as specified.

### values
* Transformation
* Non-Blocking

Values will drop the keys from an object event and just pass along the values.

### unshift
* Transformation

Adds additional elements to the begining of a stream.

## Add
Adds a value to the value of the stream. This will only have an effect on streams of numbers

```
Stream([1,2,3])
    .add(3) # :-4-5-6-|
```

## adjust
Applies a stream to the Nth member of a stream

```
Stream([1,2,3])
    .adjust(1)
        .add(3)
        .return()
    ... # :-1-5-3-|
```
    Can also be used as
```
Stream([1,2,3])
    .adjust(1, R.add(3))
    ... # :-1-5-3-|
```

## all
Alias of [every](#every)
Continues executing a stream only if all of the values in the stream pass the condition.
This function is blocking, and will never continue on an infinite stream.

```
Stream([1,2,3])
    .all(R.T) // stream will continue past here
    .all(R.even) // stream will end here
```

## allPass
Continues execution of a stream if the value at this point passes all of the functions passed in

```
Stream([1,2,3])
    .allPass(R.even, R.T) // will fail.
```
This can also be represented as

```
Stream([1,2,3])
    .allPass()
        .even()
        .T()
        .return()
```
