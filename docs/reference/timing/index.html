# Stream timing
Since some elements of streams can be time based (primarily user interaction streams), it is important to know how to handle the time dimension of streams.

All times are measured in miliseconds.

## debounce
Wait until a quiet time in the stream, and then emit the last event before the quiet. Quiet is `x` miliseconds without an event occuring. This is useful for typing events.

## throttle
Drop `x` number of events before proceeding with the stream on event `x+1`. This is useful for typing or clicking events.

## delay
Wait a certain number of milliseconds before emitting the events on the stream.

## until
Only continue with events that have been created before `x` milliseconds has elapsed

## after
Only continue with events that have been created after `x` milliseconds have elapsed

## during
Only continue with events taht have happened between `x` and `y` milliseconds.

## timestamp
Add a timestamp to any values passing through. Objects will have a timestamp appened, and non-objects will be wrapped in an object that has a timestamp.

## await
Waits for a series of events to fulfill, ignoring the order in which they fullfil- and transmitting them in the order in which they are created.
